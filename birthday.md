## Birthday Cards
Dear Izzy,

Happy birthday! Itâ€™s been so wonderful to be your friend for so many years! You are a very kind, enthusiastic, and funny
person, and going on random creative adventures with you and Piper is always a blast: from the surprisingly long and 
detailed screenplays we wrote for *The Nom Games* and OGEU, to your funny writing and excellent drawings for 
*Philosophy Bear*, to the bizarre but beautiful worlds we make in Minecraft. I can't help but admire your artistic and 
musical talents.

You are an brilliant and supportive person, and I'm so lucky to have you as my friend.

See you in the space!

Tani
